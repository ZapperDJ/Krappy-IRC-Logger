# Krappy IRC Logger
This is an IRC logger bot that I wrote ages ago and had lying around on my hard drive. The code is written when I was a noob (Not that I am better at writing code right now) so it is a bunch of crap (hence the bot name) but hey, it gets the job done.

Maybe someone finds this useful as the code is commented (I wrote crap code, but at least I had the good practice of commenting it, maybe a bit too much). If you are not a total noob like I was maybe you can use this as an example of how NOT to code, or if you are some pro coder you can have great time laughing at my code. Anyway have fun

Code is licensed as WTFPL, as this joke of a code required a joke of a license
